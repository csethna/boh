### Balance on Hand Script ###
The purpose of this script is to compare two CSVs, "master" and "copy" which
represent inventory manifests from warehouse and SalesForce record.
Script serves to easily and quickly identify differences greater than or equal to
500 items.

- **copy** refers to the `cmls available` report which can be downloaded from SalesForce.
- **master** refers to the `boh report` which can be downloaded from the GPO RADS reporting system.
